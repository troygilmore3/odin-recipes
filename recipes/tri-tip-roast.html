      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        A cut that comes from the tip of the sirloin, the result of cattle being
        both grass fed and grass finished. Tri-tip is a versatile cut that can
        be cooked on the grill &lpar;quickly seared over high heat and then
        finished over indirect heat&rpar; or slow cooked in a smoker. And to
        bring out the natural flavor and tenderness, tri-tip should rest after
        cooking and be sliced against the grain. Fun fact: It was first served
        in restaurants in the 1950s in the state of California.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 &lpar;1 &frac12; pound&rpar; beef tri tip roast, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>&frac13; cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Rub roast all over with thyme, basil, marjoram, mustard, salt, and
          black pepper. Place meat in a sealable plastic bag, seal the bag, and
          refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Pour red wine into bag with meat 4
          hours before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 450 degrees
          <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F</abbr> &lpar;230 degrees
          <abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>&rpar;. Drizzle olive oil all over the
          bottom of a roasting pan.
        </li>
        <li>Place meat in the prepared roasting pan.</li>
        <li>
          Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to
          350 degrees <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F</abbr> &lpar;175 degrees
          <abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>&rpar; and continue roasting meat until
          hot and slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes more. An
          instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140
          degrees <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F</abbr> &lpar;60 degrees
          <abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>&rpar;. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes
          before thinly slicing against the grain.
